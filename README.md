Rural Access Index (RAI) Data
The data for the Rural Access Index (RAI) used in this project was produced by the Columbia Climate School's Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN). We are using their publicly available dataset for SDG Indicator 9.1.1. Full credit goes to the CIESIN team for their significant work in computing and distributing this data. The original source can be found at their repository: CIESIN/SDG-Indicator-911.  We may make updates in the future which is why it is forked from the original.


# SDG-Indicator-911

This repository contains the scripts that the Columbia Climate School [Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN)](http://www.ciesin.org/) used to compute United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicator 9.1.1 with global open data. [SDG 9](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal9) aims to “build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.” Addressing inadequate access to roads, especially in rural areas, is critical to achieving SDG 9. Sustainable transportation helps to [eliminate poverty, promote food security, improve access to key health services, increase trade competitiveness, and bolster human rights](https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/2021-10/Transportation%20Report%202021_FullReport_Digital.pdf). As one measure of progress, the UN has established [SDG Indicator 9.1.1](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=9&Target=9.1): “Proportion of the rural population who live within 2 km of an all-season road.” This indicator is commonly known as the [Rural Access Index (RAI)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tgis.12721).

This data set presents the RAI for 209 countries and 45,162 administrative level 2 subnational units, computed using global open data sources. This work was completed in support of the [Group on Earth Observations (GEO)](https://earthobservations.org/index.php) [Human Planet Initiative (HPI)](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/HPI.php). CIESIN plans to update the SDG Indicator 9.1.1: The RAI data set annually to help countries track their progress towards SDG 9 and to facilitate international comparisons.
